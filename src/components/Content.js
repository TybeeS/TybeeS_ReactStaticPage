            Once upon a time, a hare made fun of a tortoise for always moving so slow.
            The tortoise grew annoyed and challenged the hare to a race. The hare agreed to this challenge.
            When the race started, the hare blitzed past the tortoise. The hare was so far ahead
            that he decided he had time for a rest. However, the hare remained asleep for a while.
            Eventually, the tortoise caught up to the hare with his slow pace and ended up reaching
            the finish line before him. The hare woke up and dashed towards the finish line, but
            the tortoise already claimed victory.
